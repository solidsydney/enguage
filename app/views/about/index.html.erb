      <%= image_tag "rails.png", :class => "image-of-tools" %>
      <h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>
      <p>
        Ruby on rails is an open source web frame work that is optimised for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity, it lets you write beautiful codes by favoring convention over configuration
        Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.
        Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months
        to develop can be produced in a matter of days

      <h1>mobile OS</h1>
      <p>

    <div class="tools">
      <%= image_tag "logo_jquery_215x53.gif", :class => "image-of-tools" %>
      <h1>JQuery</h1>
      <p>
        jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h1>HTML5</h1>
      <p>
        HTML5 will be the new standard for HTML.

        The previous version of HTML, HTML 4.01, came in 1999. The web has changed a lot since then.

        HTML5 is still a work in progress. However, the major browsers support many of the new HTML5 elements and APIs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tools">
      <%= image_tag "p.png", :class => "image-of-tools" %>
      <h1>CSS3</h1>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the modern standard for website presentation. When combined with structural markup language like HTML, XHTML, or XML (though not limited to these), CSS provide Internet browsers with the information that enables them to present all the  visual aspects and elements of a web document. CSS apply things like borders, spacing between paragraphs, margins, headings on images, control of font faces or colors, background colors and images, textual effects like underlined or strike-through text, layering, positioning, and a number of other presentational effects. CSS controls the presentational aspects of a web pageâ€™s design, whereas HTML, XHTML, or XML control the
        structure of a webpage, which means more than determining that certain text is a heading, other text is a paragraph, other text os a list of hyperlinks, and so on.

        By using modern standards like CSS and XHTML, you can dramatically reduce the cost of building and maintaining a website when compared to legacy HTML-only pages. You can also greatly reduce the amount of physical bandwidth and hard disk space required, resulting in immediate long-term benefits for any webmasters and web visitor</p>

    <div class="tools">
      <%= image_tag "json160.gif", :class => "image-of-tools" %>
      <h1>JSON/Javascript</h1>
      <p>
        JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.</p>
